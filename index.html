        <h3>When the Challenger launched, after 73 seconds, it exploded ðŸ’£ killing the astronauts. The cause of the disaster was the failure of both the primary and secondary redundant O-ring seals in a joint in the shuttle's right solid rocket booster (SRB). The record-low temperatures of the launch had stiffened the rubber O-rings, reducing their ability to seal the joints.(Last sentence copied from googleðŸ¤£)</h3>
